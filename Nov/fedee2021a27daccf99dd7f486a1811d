Recent reports have revealed that over 5000 Zimbabweans cross over to South Africa illegally on a daily basis.Asked what the government is planning to do about the whole situation, Minister of Home Affairs Mr. Malusi Gigaba told congress on Monday afternoon that he does not not know what to do anymore.&#8220;These people are crazy. We&#8217;ve tried everything we could to stop them from illegally entering our country. The numbers are scary&#8230; over 5000 crossover on a daily basis. They are now everywhere, we can&#8217;t even send them back to their own country. We&#8217;ve decided to rather keep them here. In fact, F#ck it , let&#8217;s just destroy the bothers and become one with Zimbabwe. The borders don&#8217;t really work. &#8221; said Minister Gigaba.
