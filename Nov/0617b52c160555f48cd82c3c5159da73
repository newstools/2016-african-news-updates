President Jacob Zuma addressed his critics this morning. A lot of people have been criticizing the president on most of the decisions has made as a president, saying that they led to the economic crises we currently have in South Africa. Opposition parties are even calling on the president to step down, stating that he had already done enough damage to the country.Commenting on the lack of intelligence in most of the decisions he has made in the past, Zuma answered his critics and those who oppose him by revealing that everything happened they way it happened because he is not left handed.&#8220;I read somewhere that left handed people are very intelligent, and that was scientifically proven. I&#8217;m unfortunately right handed, I don&#8217;t understand why people fail to understand that. I&#8217;m not Albert Einstein. &#8221; said Zuma.The ANC is now considering a left-handed candidate for the next presidential elections. They have declared that being left handed will be one of the requirements if someone wants to be president.
