Secretary general of the African National Congress Mr. Gwede Mantashe issued a strong warning to those who make jokes about president Zuma on Wednesday morning.Mantashe revealed that the president is facing a lot of issues and he has made a lot of mistakes in the past, but there is no need for one to make fun of that.&#8220;We know that our president is not perfect as he is only human like the rest of us. Yes, he took bribes here and there and even misused state funds, but there is not need for us to dwell on that and keep on making jokes about it. I promise you, anyone who is found making fun of the president, will face the law. Stop forwarding jokes about the president.&#8221; said Mantashe.Mantashe further said that he and the ANC will know if you make jokes about the president in buses, in taxis,in your cars, at work, and even at home.&#8220;Don&#8217;t think we are not listening.We know everything.&#8221; He said.
