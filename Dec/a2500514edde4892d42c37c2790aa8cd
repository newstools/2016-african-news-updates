Information reaching our front desks this morning indicates that 310 South African Police Officers have been shown the exit door for failing to pass a test that was conducted to assess their bribe-taking skills.The test which was made up of 30 oral and 5 written questions were set by 10 superiors well known for collecting bribes for the past 25 years they have been in service.A senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity explained that the SAPS had to fire the incompetent officers since they wouldn t be able to bring in money for the force.The mole further stated that the South African Police Service needs smart people who can work and protect the country and not some lazy officers who can t even pass a bribe taking test. Our country needs smart and intelligent officers to help protect our country and as an officer you should be smart. If you can t pass a simple bribery test then you need to go home, he said.He added that the South African Police Service will be recruiting new people to replace the sacked ones so interested people who are willing to join the force should apply.
