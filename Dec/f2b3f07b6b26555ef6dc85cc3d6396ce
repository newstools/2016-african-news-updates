Speaking in Johannesburg on Thursday afternoon, President Zuma advised South Africans to take care of themselves this festive season.The president warned that the festive season is a time when a lot can happen, both good and bad, as spirits are high and everyone is trying to enjoy themselves.&#8220;I urge fellow South Africans to be responsible out there. The festive season is a very critical time of the year. Everyone is happy and a lot can happen in a short space of time. Those who will be driving, drive safely. Those who will engage in sexual activities, do so in a safe manner. &#8221; said President Zuma.Zuma also encouraged men to try, if they can, to stick to their partners. &#8220;Women are like fruit But there is so much cheating out there, because men like fruit salad! If you can, stick to one partner.&#8221; he said. &nbsp;
