Recent reports have revealed that over 5000 Zimbabweans cross over to South Africa illegally on a daily basis.Asked what the government is planning to do about the thorny situation, the Minister of Home Affairs Mr. Malusi Gigaba told reporters on Tuesday afternoon that he does not not know what to do anymore. These people are crazy. We have tried everything we could to stop them from illegally entering our country. The numbers are scary over 5000 crossover on a daily basis. They are now everywhere, we can t even send them back to their own country. We ve decided to rather keep them here. In fact, Fu_ck it , let s just destroy the bothers and become one with Zimbabwe. The borders don t really work. said Minister Gigaba.The Minister also added that in a bid to generate an extra income for the department of Home Affairs and reduce the number of illegal immigrants in South Africa, Minister Gigaba he is considering selling 5 passport and ID printing machines to the Zimbabwean government so they can print their own passports and South African ID s before sending their people over to South Africa.The machines are 5 Imprint TX-11 Dye Sublimation printers with special materials only available to the South African Government. We ve realized that most of our Home Affairs branches are always crowded with illegal immigrants wanting to buy ID books and passports. Knowing that over 5000 Zimbabweans cross over to South Africa per day, illegally, we decided why not sell them printers so they can print their own ID s and Passports before they come this side. This will reduce the workload and the amount of bribes we will have to take. said Minister Gigaba.&nbsp;
