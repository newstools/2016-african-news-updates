In an effort to save some money for the department, the minister of health on Tuesday afternoon revealed a plan that the department has been working on for some time.The government spends billions of rands a year manufacturing condoms that are then distributed to be used for Free by the public.However, the free condoms do not get distributed everywhere in the country and people end up having unprotected sex because branded condoms are expensive.To those unfortunate people who do not have access to these free condoms. The minister of Health suggested that they tie a knot at the end of the foreskin, if they still have one.This wonderful plan will save the government over R2b in 2017 and even more in years to come.The department is working on another plan that can be used by those who are already circumcised. Taking a shower after sex is the only solution for now.&nbsp;
